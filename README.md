# Atelier git

The presentation and resources used during the git workshop given by Louvain-li-Nux (currently francophone only).

## Building

This presentation uses [Marp](https://marp.app/) for its slides:

```console
npm -g install @marp-team/marp-cli
```

You can serve it as such:

```console
marp -w -s .
```

## Extra features

- English language slides.
- CI/CD setup (spellchecker, formatting, etc).
- Show a screenshot of going into settings before going to the SSH/GPG keys tab, because some people have a hard time finding it.

## Notes

- Do break consistency by not adding dots at the end of commands, even if they're in a sentence. It can confuse people so the consistency isn't worth it.
